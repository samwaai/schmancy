  <h1>Guard Test</h1>
  <p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:5176/area/routing">http://localhost:5176/area/routing</a> to test the guards functionality.</p>

  <h2>Test Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the routing demo page</li>
    <li>Try navigating to "Profile" (should be blocked if not authenticated)</li>
    <li>Try navigating to "Dashboard" (should redirect to login)</li>
    <li>Try navigating to "Premium" (should test async guard)</li>
    <li>Check console for guard execution logs</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The fix ensures that route guards are properly matched and evaluated by carrying the original route configuration through the pipeline instead of trying to reverse-engineer it from the resolved component name.</p>
