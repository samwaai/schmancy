# SchmancyGrid

`SchmancyGrid` is a flexible grid layout component built with Lit, incorporating the `animejs` library for animations. This component provides a versatile grid structure with support for various configurations, including flow, alignment, justification, gap size, and animation effects.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mhmo91/schmancy
```

## Usage

```js
<!-- Import the scrip -->
import SchmancyGrid from '@mhmo91/schmancy'
```

```html
<!-- Use the component in your HTML -->
<schmancy-grid flow="row" align="center" justify="start" gap="md" cols="3" rows="2" wrap>
	<!-- Add your content here -->
	<div>Item 1</div>
	<div>Item 2</div>
	<!-- ... -->
</schmancy-grid>
```

## Properties

- `flow` (String): Controls the grid flow (`row`, `col`, `dense`, `row-dense`, `col-dense`). Default is `row`.
- `align` (String): Align items along the cross-axis (`start`, `center`, `end`, `stretch`, `baseline`). Default is `stretch`.
- `justify` (String): Justify items along the main axis (`start`, `center`, `end`, `stretch`). Default is `stretch`.
- `gap` (String): Set the gap size between grid items (`none`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`). Default is `none`.
- `cols` (Number): Number of columns in the grid.
- `rows` (Number): Number of rows in the grid.
- `anime` (Object): Animation configuration using the `animejs` library. Default is an empty object.
- `wrap` (Boolean): Whether to allow items to wrap onto multiple lines. Default is `false`.

```

### Grid with Animation

```html
<schmancy-grid
	flow="col"
	align="center"
	justify="center"
	gap="md"
	cols="4"
	anime="{ easing: 'easeInOutQuad', duration: 1000 }"
>
